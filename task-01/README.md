# Task 1: Build an Unsupervised Learning Model on a
#### Dataset(Clustering Model)

1.  DataSets 
Here we are using ``` Mall_Customers.csv```


2.  Preprocessing 
```CustomerID', 'Gender``` are the feature that we are using here.
- used the Standard Scalar
- used the elbow method to find the number of Cluster.
- used the PCA to reduce the features.

3. Model development
-  Applying the K-means for the clustering 
- Silhouette Score,Davies-Bouldin Index, and Inertia.
- used Matplotlib for visualization

4. Result
As a result plotted the graph between the ```Annual Income ``` and ``` Spending Score```
we used the real world Data from kaggle
