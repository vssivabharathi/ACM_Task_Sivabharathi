# Basic Deep Learning Network for Binary Classification

1. datasets
Here we used the ```heart.csv``` taken form the Kaggle.

2. Preprocessing
- no null values found 

3. Model Development
- used deep learning with 4 layers
- used the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
- used ADAM and learning rate parameters were set.

4. Evaluation and Result
- Loss =  0.6547960042953491
- Accuracy =  0.8552631735801697
